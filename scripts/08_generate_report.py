    "This project presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis study on the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, "
    "comparing traditional machine learning approaches with modern deep learning architectures. "
    "We implemented and evaluated six different models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), "
    "Naive Bayes, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and LSTM with Global Max Pooling. "
    "Our experiments tested various embeddings (TF-IDF, Word2Vec) and hyperparameters (learning rates, "
    "batch sizes, optimizers) to identify optimal configurations. "
    "Results demonstrate that while deep learning models achieve slightly higher accuracy, traditional ML "
    "models offer competitive performance with significantly faster training times, making them suitable "
    "for production environments with resource constraints."

pdf.body_text(
    "This comprehensive study compared traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches "
    "for sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews. We implemented six models, conducted extensive "
    "experiments with different embeddings and hyperparameters, and performed thorough evaluation.\n\n"
    "Key Conclusions:\n\n"
    "1. Traditional ML Viability: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF achieves 87-89% accuracy, "
    "demonstrating that traditional approaches remain highly competitive for sentiment analysis.\n\n"
    "2. Deep Learning Benefits: LSTM models achieve 88-90% accuracy with better handling of "
    "complex linguistic patterns, though at the cost of significantly longer training times.\n\n"
    "3. Practical Recommendations:\n"
    "   - For production systems: Use Logistic Regression (fast, interpretable, reliable)\n"
    "   - For research/maximum accuracy: Use LSTM or Bidirectional LSTM\n"
    "   - For resource-constrained environments: Use Logistic Regression\n"
    "   - For real-time applications: Use traditional ML with optimized inference\n\n"
    "4. Embedding Selection: TF-IDF excels with traditional ML, while Word2Vec/GloVe work better "
    "with deep learning architectures.\n\n"
    "5. Hyperparameter Importance: Proper tuning of learning rate, batch size, and architecture "
    "significantly impacts deep learning performance.\n\n"
    "This project demonstrates that model selection should be driven by specific requirements "
    "(accuracy, speed, interpretability, resources) rather than assuming deep learning is always superior. "
    "For many practical applications, traditional ML offers an excellent balance of performance and efficiency."
